          To my dearest Bhukkad,

          Happy 24th Birthday, my love! ðŸŽ‰
          
          It feels like just yesterday, on March 9, 2022, when our journey began. From that moment, I have been captivated by your beautiful eyes and the way your hair dances in the breeze. Every day with you fills my heart with so much joy, and I can't help but smile whenever I think of you.
          
          You inspire me every single day, with your determination and hard work as you prepare for your banking career. I know you're going to achieve your dream of becoming an IBPS SO very soon, and I will be right beside you, cheering you on every step of the way.
          
          On your special day, I just want you to know how lucky I am to have you in my life. Youâ€™ve made my world brighter, and I canâ€™t wait for all the beautiful moments weâ€™ll create together in the future.
          
          Enjoy your day to the fullest, Bhukkad! May this year bring you closer to your dreams and fill your life with happiness and love.

          With all my love, Divyansh
        </p>
